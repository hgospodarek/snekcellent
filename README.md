# ==README for Future Me:

## Snekcellent
is a learning side-project so I can learn how to make a basic tracker and hopefully make it user-friendly AF to incorporate into my other shit.

Also knowing that I have an animal that can fail silently is hecking scary, yo. Gonna track dat snek.

Mai 1st __rails 5__ O_O _wooow_ such new.

__Postgres__ duh.

Probs gonna try __Bootstrap__ or somethin other than Foundation for dis.

Focus __rails__ first then probs __React__ it up later cause I need a refresher.

## Do Stuff
1. Clone dis `git@github.com:hgospodarek/snekcellent.git`
2. `cd snekcellent`
3. `rake db:create`
4. `rake db:migrate`
